# PCB Designing Guide

Welcome to my **PCB Designing** repository! In this repository, I will share **PCB design projects** that I have done and give a brief idea about **schematic creation**, **PCB layout**, and **manufacturing processes**. Additionally, I will cover essential **theories**, **key terminologies**, and important **industry standards** that I have learned in my journey, which form the foundation of PCB designing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced designer, this repository will serve as a comprehensive resource for **PCB design knowledge**.
